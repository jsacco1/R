# R bioinformatics


This repository contains R scripts to calculate and graph incidence rates and allele frequencies. 

I have also included a run-through of a limma tutorial. Limma is a BioConductor package commonly used in RNA-Seq pipelines for differential expression analysis. 

### Query GDC for RNA-Seq data

RNA-Seq datasets can be accessed via the GDC repository at the following link:
